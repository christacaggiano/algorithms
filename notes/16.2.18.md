# Dynamic Programming and Optimization

```
F(n)
  A = [0, 1]
  For k in range (2, n+1)
    A.append(A[k-1] + A[k-2])
  Return(A(n))
```

Removing arrays in python can be an increase 15-fold increase in speed

## Counting Rabbits with Dynamic Programming

* population begins in the first month, with a pair of newborn rabbits
* rabbits reach reproductive age after one month
* in any given month, every rabbit of reproductive age mates with another rabbit of reproductive age
* exactly one month after two rabbits mate, they produce one male and one female
* rabbits never die or stop reproducing

my solution:

```python

# k = number of pairs of offspring
# n = number of months
# compute value for n=5, k=3

k = 3
n = 5

rabbits = [(1) for i in range(k)]

for month in range(n):
  for rabbit in rabbits:
    if rabbits[rabbit] != 1:
      rabbits.append((1))
    else:
      rabbits[rabbits] +=1

len(rabbits)

```

a good solution:

```python

def rabbits(n, k):

  a, b = 1, 1

  for i in range(2, n):
    a, b = b, k*a + b

  return b



```

If the rabbits can die after m months. Set m = 3

```python
def mortal_rabbits(n, m):

  f = [n]*100

  for i in range(2, n):
    f[i] = f[i-1] + f[i-2]
    if i>=m:
      f[i] -= f[(i-m) -1]
    return f[i]

```

## Knapsack problem

Imagine a homework assignment that has 7 parts that have different point values
and take different amounts of time to complete. There is no partial credit.
What parts would you do if you had a fixed amount of time?



| | A  | B | C | D | E | F | G |
|--| ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|values |7   |  9 | 5   |12    |  14 |  6  | 12  |
|time |3   |  4 | 2   |6    |  7 |  3  | 5  |

```
// recursive algorithm

value(n, S):
{
  if (n==0) return 0;
  if (s_n > S result = Value(n-1, S)
  else result = max{v_N + Value(n-1, S-s_n), Value(n-1, S)};
  return result;
}
```

```

// top-down dynamic programming approach

Value(n, S)
{
  if (n==0) return 0;
  if(arr[n][S] != unknown) return arr[n][S];
  if (s_n > S) result = Value(n-1, S);
  else result = max{v_n + Value(n-1, S-s_n), Value(n-1, S)};
  arr[n][S] = result;
  return result;

}
```
