# Clustering

## introduction

What is clustering? Simply, grouping objects together that have a meaningful relationship

**Binary relationship** relationships between two objects.

Examples- reflexivity, symmetry, transitive

## Relationships

### binary
A binary relationship that satisfies all three of these properties is an **equivalence relation.**

Sequence similarity: is not an equivalence relationship (reflexive, symmetric, but not transitive)

### distance
**Distance relation:** function that considers the distance between two objects in a geometric sense

Must satisfy:
  1. D(a, a) = 0
  2. D(a, b) >= 0
  3. D(a, b) = D(b, a)
  4. D(a, b) <= D(a, c) + D(c, b)

examples- euclidian distance, city block

### similarity

A **similarity function** requires that
  1. 0 <= S(a, b) <= 1
  2. S(a, a) = 1
  3. S(a, b) = S(b, a)

Similarity relationship examples- % identity of strings, Tanimoto similarity of bitstrings

### missing values
if we don't have complete data for similarity relationships. Can remove the objects, replace with
an average, use prior knowledge and replace with most likely value

## Normalizing values
Scaling so that all values contribute equally -- **normalizing**

Ex. divide by the mean absolute deviation
`Change each xi to zi, where
  zi = xi - m / S
  S = 1/n {|x0-m| + |x1-m| + … + |xn-m|}
  m = 1/n {x0 + x1 + … + xn}
`
