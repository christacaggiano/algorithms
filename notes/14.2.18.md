# Dynamic Programming

Divide and conquer technique - formulate solution as a recurrence relation

Hallmarks of a dynamic programming problem

* optimal substructure
  - an optimal solution can be built from optimal sub-solutions
* overlapping subproblems
  - the same subproblems keep showing up

2 approaches:
* bottom-up method
  - there must be an evaluation order that solves smaller problems before larger ones
  - by storing and recalling the solutions to smaller problems, the large ones can be efficiently computed
* top-down with memoization
  - follow the usual recursive procedure, but store your result along the way
* both methods have asymptotic running time
* dynamic programming is always a time-memory trade-off
