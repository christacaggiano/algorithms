# reproducible bioinformatics code 

1. Use [anaconda or miniconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/macos.html)

2. Version control - git visualization 
	* [visualization of branches](https://www.gitkraken.com/) 
	* [class git](https://github.com/ucsf-bmi-203)
	* git not great for long-term distribution, use code archiving 

3. Continuous integration testing - makes sure new code doesn't break old code 
	* [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)
	* every time you make a commit to master, runs tests in an online container
	* unit testing at the bare minimum 
	* removes tendency to write code that is dependent on a specific local environment 

4. Consistent python project structure
	* [example](https://github.com/ucsf-bmi-203/example)
