# Clustering

## introduction

What is clustering? Simply, grouping objects together that have a meaningful relationship

**Binary relationship** relationships between two objects.

Examples- reflexivity, symmetry, transitive

A binary relationship that satisfies all three of these properties is an **equivalence relation.**

Sequence similarity: is not an equivalence relationship (reflexive, symmetric, but not transitive)

Distance relation: function that considers the distance between two objects in a geometric sense

Must satisfy:
  1. D(a, a) = 0
  2. D(a, b) >= 0
  3. D(a, b) = D(b, a)
  4. D(a, b) <= D(a, c) + D(c, b)
