# Graph algorithms

## introduction 

A graph is a set of vertices and edges 


Path = a sequence of edges connecting distinct vertices 


Cycle = path where start and end vertices are the same 


## Graphs in Biology 


examples - biological pathways, phylogenic tree, neural net, hidden markov model  


## Computing with Graphs 

Breadth-first search 

```
Breadth_First_Search(G, start): 
	for vertex in G: 
		vertex.visited = false 

	Q = new empty queue 
	Q.enqueue(start)

	while Q is not empty: 
		v=Q.dequeue() 
		for n adjacent to v: 
			if !n.visted: 
				n.visited = true 
				Q.enqueue(n) 
```


Depth first search, implemented with recursion 

```
Depth_First_Search(G, start): 
	v.visited = true 

	for adjacent to v: 
		if !n.visited: 
			Depth_First_Search(G, n)

``` 


Shorted path- Dijkstra's Algorithm 


Shortest_Path(G, start):
```	
	Q = []

	for vertex v in G:
		v.dist= Infinity
		v.prev= NULL
		Q.append(v)

	start.dist= 0

	while Q is not empty:
		v = v in Q where v.distis smallest
		Q.remove(v)

		for each neighbor u of v:
			x = v.dist+ edge_len(v, u)
			if x < u.dist:
				u.dist= x
				u.prev= v
```

## Path traversal 

### Hamiltonian paths
Hamiltonian path visits each vertex exactly once. Finding a Hamiltonian path in an arbitrary graph is NP-complete, and finding a Hamiltonian path of minimum cost is the Traveling Salesman Problem 


### Eulerian paths 
Visits each edge exactly once. Eulerian cycles require that all nodes in a graph have an even degree. Can be done in linear time.
